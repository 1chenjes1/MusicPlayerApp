# My Personal Project

## Music Player Application

This application will be a simple version of a mp3 application,
which will play a song and have the option of pausing, skipping and replaying.
The app will start with a limited library with default songs that are available to the user.
However, there will be the option for the user to upload their own sound files.
In addition, there will be a playlist option, where playlists can be created, viewed, and deleted. 
This application will be a simplified version of already existing applications such as **Spotify** or **Apple Music**.
Anyone wanting to create playlists that play their specific songs can utilise this application.

As someone who is passionate about music and has been involved in making and producing music their whole life, I am 
taking the opportunity to create a personal project where I can use my interests and meaningfully integrate them 
in an academic setting.
